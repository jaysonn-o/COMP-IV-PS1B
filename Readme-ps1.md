# PS1b - PhotoMagic

**Name**: Jason Ossai

## Functionality:
Using the FibLFSR class, the program encrypts and decrypts pictures. It satisfies every need, including the following:
- Can write and read pictures.
- Shows both the unaltered and altered photos.
- Uses the LFSR seed to encrypt and decrypt pictures correctly.

## Additional Credit: To enable alphanumeric passwords, the program first converts each character to its binary ASCII equivalent, which is then used as the LFSR seed.

## Remarks: Ensured that I supplied a binary seed along with the filenames for the input and output.
